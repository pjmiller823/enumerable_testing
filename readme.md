# README
Enumerable_testing is the adaptation of an assignment from The Iron Yard. The original assignment was to define a series of enumerables the use of provided tests. The only catch was that the enumerables were disabled and we could only work with "each." You can view the tests in enumerable_test.rb, and the answers can be seen in your_code_here.rb.

My goal with this file is to extend the project to cover more enumerables. I will update the file and README as I progress.
